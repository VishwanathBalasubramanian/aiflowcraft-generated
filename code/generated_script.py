To implement the Transaction Management System as described, we need to connect to the database, retrieve the transaction data, and then format it into two columns as specified. Below is a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to achieve this. We'll use SQLite for demonstration purposes, but the SQL query can be adapted for other databases as needed.

```python
import sqlite3
from prettytable import PrettyTable

# Function to connect to the database
def connect_to_db(db_name):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name)
    return conn

# Function to fetch transaction data
def fetch_transactions(conn):
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    query = """
    SELECT transaction_id, account_number, transaction_type, amount, currency, transaction_date, description
    FROM transactions
    """
    cursor.execute(query)
    transactions = cursor.fetchall()
    return transactions

# Function to display transactions in two columns
def display_transactions(transactions):
    table = PrettyTable()
    table.field_names = ["Transaction ID", "Account Number", "Transaction Type", "Amount", "Currency", "Transaction Date", "Description"]
    
    for transaction in transactions:
        table.add_row(transaction)
    
    print("Column 1: Transaction ID, Account Number, Transaction Type, Amount")
    print("Column 2: Currency, Transaction Date, Description")
    print("-" * 80)
    
    for transaction in transactions:
        print(f"Transaction ID: {transaction[0]}")
        print(f"Account Number: {transaction[1]}")
        print(f"Transaction Type: {transaction[2]}")
        print(f"Amount: {transaction[3]}")
        print(f"Currency: {transaction[4]}")
        print(f"Transaction Date: {transaction[5]}")
        print(f"Description: {transaction[6]}")
        print("-" * 80)

# Main function to run the system
def main():
    db_name = 'transactions.db'  # Database name
    conn = connect_to_db(db_name)
    transactions = fetch_transactions(conn)
    display_transactions(transactions)
    conn.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Database Connection**: The `connect_to_db` function connects to the SQLite database.
2. **Fetching Data**: The `fetch_transactions` function retrieves all transactions from the `transactions` table.
3. **Displaying Data**: The `display_transactions` function formats and prints the transaction data in two columns as specified.

### Notes:
- The `prettytable` library is used for formatting the table. You can install it using `pip install prettytable`.
- The SQL query assumes the table name is `transactions`. If the table name is different, update the query accordingly.
- The `main` function orchestrates the connection, data fetching, and display processes.

Decision: APPROVED  
Reason: The code snippet effectively connects to the database, retrieves transaction data, and formats it into two columns as specified in the design document.
